SITUATION
- Logs are critical for debugging and monitoring applications
- Manual log checking is slow and error-prone
- Production environments generate thousands of log entries daily

TASK
- Build a log analysis tool to automate log parsing and summarization
- Make it user-friendly and easy to integrate into workflows
- Ensure it can be used from command line like real DevOps tools

ACTION
- Created log_analyzer.py (Day 04): Reads log file, counts levels, writes summary
- Enhanced with OOP using LogAnalyzer class (Day 05): Better structure and maintainability
- Built CLI interface using argparse (Day 06): Command-line arguments for file paths and filtering
- Designed comprehensive workflow (Day 07): Planning before coding mindset
- Made code production-ready: Error handling, file validation, clean output

RESULT
- Reduced time to analyze logs from minutes to seconds
- Tool is reusable across different log files
- Can be integrated into monitoring systems
- Serves as foundation for more advanced log analysis features
- Demonstrates core DevOps automation principles
